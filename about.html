            My Name is Paul and I'm a software engineer at Leidos, where I work on various projects developing and improving different softwares, 
            inlcuding programs coded in C, java, and python.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found my passion for technology whilst I was studying at school. I studied computer science at both GCSE and A-level which gave me a 
            tase of programming and the fundementals around computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time I left college I had secured a place to study Computer science as the university of Portsmouth, however an opportunity came 
            up, at the place in which I am currently working, for an apprenticeship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial apprenticeship was just a stepping stone however I gained qualifications to be a network technicition, which again invloved 
            learning the fundementals of computer science. From this I achieved qualifications from both microsoft and BCS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward to present day and I am currently a Software Engineer. Again this opportunity came up as an apprenticeship at Degree level, 
            which was a natural progression from the previous role and apprentcieship.
        </p>
